Terms of Service; Didn't Read has an api and posts their source code on github. 
I'm not sure if their project has room for beginners to contribute, but I'm interested in the subject matter.

If I get good enough to be useful, I'd be interested in short-term, local projects for public good like this one:
http://www.dclibrary.org/node/28915

This project uses Python to help in the Hurricane Sandy recovery effort.
It's unlikely that I'm good enough to contribute yet, but it provides something towards which I can aspire.
(I learned about it through an email Aaron Titus sent to the DC PYthon Meetup list.

When someone mentions a book worth reading, it might be neat to build a web scraper
that would automatically search the DC Library and Montgomery County Public Library
to see if it's available. (Note to self: Does their usual catalog include Overdrive
listings, or is that separate?) Maybe also search Amazon to get a baseline price.
worldcat.org attempts to do this, but they don't list DC or Moco libraries.
Here's a link to worldcat's API: http://www.worldcat.org/affiliate/tools?atype=wcapi
