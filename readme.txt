I'm not sure if their project has room for beginners to contribute, but I'm interested in the subject matter.

If I get good enough to be useful, I'd be interested in short-term, local projects for public good like this one:

It's unlikely that I'm good enough to contribute yet, but it provides something towards which I can aspire.
(I learned about it through an email Aaron Titus sent to the DC PYthon Meetup list.
